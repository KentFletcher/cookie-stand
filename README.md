Salmon Cookies Project
by Kent Sheats
** I relied heavily on the help of my classmates, at various points of the project: Joe Pennock, Joseph Zabaleta, Paul Depew, and Peyton Cysewski.  And even more on the assistance and multiple class reviews and demos, both in class and posted on class repo, by instructor Jacob Knaack. Also the moral support of Kenneth Harman!
